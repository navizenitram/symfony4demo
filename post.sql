The stronger you identify with the ideas of who you think you are, the more\r\n                likely you are to fall into a crisis. The deeper that identification is, the harder it is to get out of\r\n                that state.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>If you want to achieve a state of happiness, you have to see beyond your ego and the internal dialogue.\r\n                Make a decision to give up the need for control, the need to be approved, and the need to judge. Those\r\n                are the three things that the ego does all the time. Control, Approval, Judgement. It is very important\r\n                to be aware of them every time they arise.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <blockquote>It is very easy to fall into the trap of enjoying a yoga class, turning it into physical Yoga\r\n                only to\r\n                feed the ego.\r\n            </blockquote>\r\n            <p>In the philosophy of yoga, the ego is considered an obstacle as long as it is in charge of our thoughts,\r\n                instead of being used for the service of the soul and the Divine. An important thing to know is that\r\n                \"the EGO is not combated, the EGO is exposed\", and that the best place to see it reflected is in the\r\n                YOGA MAT. In our case...the PADDLE BOARD!\r\n\r\n            <h2>Become aware</h2>\r\n            <p>Become aware that the Ego is going to be there during the practice, whispering to you...\"How well I do\r\n                it, I’m the best in the class!\", or \"oh, no, look at me, I’m so clumsy!\", or \"you\'ll never be able to do\r\n                these postures, what am i doing here?” and so on. Try to take distance from this voice, separate\r\n                yourself from it, listen to it... without getting hooked.</p>\r\n            <h2>Surrender</h2>\r\n            <p>Surrender is the key, it does not mean abandoning. It is simply not to fight against the voice of the\r\n                EGO. It is to accept that if you can not make a perfect posture, that you will eventually fall in the\r\n                water doing paddle surf yoga. Stay focused on breathing and let the inspiration do its job. Flow and do\r\n                not force yourself beyond what your body can do, or abandon by listening to the Ego say that you can\r\n                not. It\'s letting go. It is to open space between the stimulus and the reaction with each breath.</p>\r\n            <h2>Overcome your wishes</h2>\r\n            <p>Another way to reduce the ego through our physical practice is to cut back on desires, practice with zero\r\n                expectations. The ego feeds on desires, so this tactic helps diminish its domination of our experience.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>As yogis, we are destined to change the identification of the separated self to the expression of the\r\n                individualized soul of the Spirit, using the instruments of the body and the mind to communicate and\r\n                interact with others.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <blockquote> While practicing SUP Yoga always remember: «DO NOT COMBAT YOUR EGO, EXPOSE IT, HAVE FUN FALLING\r\n                IN THE\r\n                WATER», if you catch it, take some distance from it. It will become smoke, that disappears.\r\n            </blockquote>\r\n            <h2>TAKE A SELFIE\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p>Ok, once we acknowledge the importance of the ego and our mind in yoga…\r\n                Let’s take a beautiful selfie practising SUP yoga! It looks amazing on Instagram, we all know it, and no\r\n                matter how much we work on our Ego we will always be seducing creatures.\r\n            </p>', '2019-05-07 00:00:00'),

The exercise corresponds to the phases and rhythms of the sun related to\r\n                the rhythms of the human being during the day, so each asana represents a solar cycle.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>This sequence, repeated several times, is a full-fledged set-up to start our yoga class, our surf session\r\n                or the beginning of our day. Greeting to the Sun warms up and prepares joints, articulations and muscles\r\n                in the body, helping us avoid injuries in later exercises, and also train our mind to observe our\r\n                thinking, stay focus, and be open and ready to practise meditation.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>When we internalize both all the asanas, and the corresponding pranayama composing Surya Namaskar, we can\r\n                choose to use it as a very vigorous warm-up session, a demanding and energizing exercise, or to go\r\n                through it gently, slowing and connecting to a deep grounding breath, always connecting breath and\r\n                movement.</p>\r\n            <p>As an anecdote: <br/> The classical sequence we practice today was created in 1929 by a Hindu named Bala\r\n                Sahib, who devised this exercise as a training method for professional wrestlers to acquire strength and\r\n                flexibility.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>In SURF Yoga Ibiza we follow this traditional, almost sacred warm up for your yoga sessions in the water,\r\n                but you will see we give it a subtle twist. A sun salutation from the water must be slightly different\r\n                from the water than from the earth!\r\n            </p>', '2019-05-05 00:00:00'),

Planet Earth\r\n                is formed mostly by this element, our body is 90% water. It is the essential liquid for the development\r\n                of life, the element that makes our planet special and of which we are trained. This is why this element\r\n                is the one we are most linked to, even if we do not realize. Sometimes we do not notice how important\r\n                water is, just as we do not notice everyday things like dreams, feelings or intuition, all of them\r\n                linked to this element that contributes so much to us.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h2>Emotional element</h2>\r\n            <p>The water is subtle, delicate and soft when it runs through a stream or falls in the form of a drizzle;\r\n                but it is also a deadly element when it is out of control. There’s a reason why it is said that water is\r\n                directly related to emotions; they are capable of expressing the best of the human being or the worst if\r\n                we are not able to control them, so it is recommended to work with the water element if we are passing\r\n                delicate moments on the emotional plane.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h2>Awakening intuition</h2>\r\n            <p>Water is the element of the unconscious of the deepest ones of the Other Side, therefore working with it\r\n                will help us to awaken to this other reality, to the subtle worlds and to be more receptive. Since\r\n                ancient times it has been said that water is a portal for wells, lakes, rafts ... They are all mirrors\r\n                that give us back our reflection, but they are also doors on the other side...or other sides.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h2>Empower passive and constant energy</h2>\r\n            <p>This element can also be a good ally if we lack discipline when tackling tasks, if it’s difficult to\r\n                start new activities or if we leave them halfway done. If something has water it is unstoppable, sooner\r\n                or later it will achieve its objectives. Working with the water element will give us that subtle, but\r\n                constant, passive but lasting energy.\r\n            </p>', '2019-04-09 00:00:00'),
